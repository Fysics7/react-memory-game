# react-memory

This is a memory game app built with React. It will eventually be a succession of commits going through the process. You can follow this progress by stepping through the commits starting from the beginning.

## Setup

- Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

- `npm run serve` will run the app at `localhost:4000`. You will notice that hot loading is enabled so changes you make will magically appear without refreshing. (this works for most things but certain state changes you may have to actually refresh)
